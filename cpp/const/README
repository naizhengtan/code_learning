g++ --std=c++11 -o const const.cpp

(1) const reference

ref = entity;

ref\entity     const       non-const
const          Good        Good
non-const      Not Allow   Good

(2) pointer to const

ptr = &entity;

ptr\entity      const      non-const
const           Good       Good
non-const       Not Allow  Good
convert         Good       -- 

(3) const pointer
The variable pointer cannot be modified, rather than the object it points to.


(4) constant expression
- constexpr can be initialized by the very simple expression that can be calculated
  at compilation time.
- constexpr pointer means the pointer itself is const, rather than the object it points
  to is const.
